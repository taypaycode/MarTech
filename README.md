# MarTech Journey Analytics Platform

An innovative marketing analytics platform that integrates data from various marketing technology tools to provide a comprehensive view of the customer journey, enabling more effective campaign optimization and improved marketing ROI.

## Project Overview

The MarTech Journey Analytics platform addresses the challenge of fragmented marketing data across multiple systems by creating a unified view of customer interactions across all touchpoints. This end-to-end solution connects data from advertising platforms, CRM systems, website analytics, and email marketing tools to reveal insights that would otherwise remain hidden in data silos.

## Key Features

- **Customer Journey Mapping**: Visual representation of the complete customer journey, from first touchpoint to conversion and beyond, with path analysis.
- **Multi-Touch Attribution**: Sophisticated attribution models that accurately distribute conversion credit across multiple marketing touchpoints.
- **Audience Segmentation**: AI-powered segmentation that identifies valuable customer cohorts based on behavior, demographics, and engagement patterns.
- **ROI Forecasting**: Predictive analytics that forecast potential ROI of marketing initiatives based on historical performance and market trends.

## Technical Architecture

The platform is built on a modern, scalable architecture:

- **Data Collection**: Segment for customer data collection and integration with 300+ marketing tools
- **Data Warehouse**: Google BigQuery for storing and processing large volumes of marketing data
- **Data Processing**: Python data pipeline with custom ETL processes and machine learning models
- **Backend API**: Node.js RESTful API connecting the data layer with the frontend
- **Frontend**: React-based interactive dashboard with data visualization components
- **Deployment**: Containerized application deployed on Google Cloud Platform
